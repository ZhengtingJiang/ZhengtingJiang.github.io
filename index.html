<h1>Personal Profile</h1>
<p>Hi! This is Zhengting Jiang, I read Applied Mathematics with minor Data Science and Big Data Technology at the School of Mathematics 
    of Shandong University (BSc 2019-2023). I am now studying MSc in Bioinformatics and Systems Biology (joint degree) at Vrije Univeristy of Amsterdam and University of Amsterdam,
    I expected to graduate in June 2025. I also plan to take a Ph.D degree in relative areas, especially in cancer analysis, precision medicine, medical genetics, and bioinformatics.
    This websites will introduce some courses related with machine learning, deep learning, AI and some other subjects that strongly related to Bioinformatics. 
    If you have any issues you can easily <a href="mailto:tohsaka60@outlook.com">contact me</a>. You could click here for my CV (under construction).

<h1>Introduction to Machine Learning</h1>
<p>The introduction is based on <a href="https://cs229.stanford.edu/">CS229.Stanford</a>, <a href="https://mlvu.github.io/">Machine Learning @VU</a> and
    <a href="https://uvaml1.github.io/">Machine Learning for UvA.</a>
    All contents rights to the original author of all if there is any wrong please contact me as soon as possible to do delete processing.</p>
<p>There are three parts of the courses, the first parts is to give you the basis of mathematics, including probability, statistics, calculus, linear algebra, and some convex optimization theory.
    The second part is to give you the basis of machine learning theory, and the last part is about the application of machine learning theory. I personally advice you to studying at least one or two chapters per week.
    Various problems and answers would be uploaded, however, this is a huge project so this process may be delaied. I will put this after all chapters uploaded. This is also my own study notes, so errors must be everywhere,
    if you find any errors please contact me, thank you.

<h1>Introduction to Algorithms in Sequence Analysis (under construction)</h1>
<p>This is the lecture notes for the course <a href="https://studiegids.vu.nl/EN/courses/2023-2024/X_405050#/">Algorithms in Sequence Analysis (X_405050)</a>.I feel painful while taking this course,
    because there are many things to memorize. You could easily find the course objective and some materials in the study guide of VU Amsterdam. 
    There are few 14 chapters and 3 assignments for the course. However, I will not upload any assignments to the page because the course is still going on. 
    I will only update the course notes.
